Simple command line tool that allows to find overlap hours between two time zones, with visualization.

```
$ time_overlap count 8 16 +00:00 Bangkok 4
```

Assuming that you are in Bangkok and the target time zone is UTC +0
and you want to cover 4 hours - from 8:00 to 16:00.

In most cases it suggests 2 options (cover first 4 hours: 8-12 or last: 12-16).
